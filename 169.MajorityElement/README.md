# 169. Majority Element

**Difficulty:** Easy

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

## Examples

### Example 1

- **Input:** `nums = [3,2,3]`
- **Output:** `3`

### Example 2

- **Input:** `nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]`
- **Output:** `2`

## Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- The input is generated such that a majority element will exist in the array.

## Follow-up

Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space?

## Solution

The optimal solution uses the **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm** to find the majority element in linear time and constant space.

**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
